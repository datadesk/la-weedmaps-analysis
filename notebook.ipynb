    "# Los Angeles Weedmaps analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "By [Ben Welsh](https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis was conducted for the May 29, 2019, Los Angeles Times story [\" Black market cannabis shops thrive in L.A. even as city cracks down\"](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-weed-pot-dispensaries-illegal-marijuana-weedmaps-black-market-los-angeles-20190529-story.html). It found more than 220 dispensaries inside Los Angeles advertised on Weedmaps.com that are not on the city's list of authorized retailers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the volatilty of the marijuana business and the high frequency of law enforcement actions against illegal operators, the number of listings can vary from day to day. So if you rerun this notebook you are likely to get slightly different results."
